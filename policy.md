Purpose 
The Consortium of Centres for Nursing and Midwifery Education (CCNME) is committed to upholding and maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity to benefit both learners and staff, and to maintaining learner and public trust in nursing and midwifery education. The core values of academic integrity; honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage (National Academic Integrity Network (NAIN), 2021) are central to all CCNME activities including teaching, learning and assessments. 
The rapid evolution of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GEN AI) presents both opportunities and challenges for educators and learners in academic and professional development contexts (Foltynek et al, 2023). In this dynamic landscape, CCNME staff must remain vigilant in promoting ethical AI use and safeguarding academic integrity (NAIN, 2023). The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, fidelity, veracity, privacy and confidentiality have been adopted to guide this procedure (NMBI, 2025).
This procedure outlines ethical and procedural guidance for the responsible use of AI, including academic integrity principles within the CCNME.

Glossary of Terms
Artificial Intelligence refers to machine-based systems that can generate content, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence real or virtual environments (Quality and Qualifications Ireland, 2023) 
Generative Artificial Intelligence “computational techniques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content such as text images or audio from training data” (Feuerriegel et al, 2024)

Policy Statement

The integration of Gen AI into nursing and midwifery education is revolutionising the way future healthcare professionals are trained for the complexities of healthcare delivery. However, concerns remain about the potential for Gen AI to undermine academic integrity. Educators have responded in various ways, ranging from avoiding AI entirely to integrating it into coursework with clear guidelines and ethical frameworks (Archibald & Clark, 2023). Critical challenges include ensuring that learners maintain moral reasoning, avoid over-reliance on AI tools, and understand the limitations of AI-generated outputs (Cano et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2024). Mental well-being is a critical concern in nursing and midwifery, where professionals often face significant stress, emotional demands, and risk of burnout. The use of AI-driven simulations can support mental well-being by creating stable learning environments. These simulations can enhance knowledge integration, foster reflective practice, and build learner confidence, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and prepared workforce (Ma et al., 2025).

To responsibly integrate AI into nursing and midwifery education, strong leadership is needed to develop organisational policies that support academic integrity and model the ethical use of AI. This includes transparency in authorship and proper attribution that fosters responsibility and accountability. This in turn promotes well-being and public safety to ensure equity and sustainability (WHO, 2021) while simultaneously upholding the core values of nursing and midwifery.

Appendiz 1: AI Assessment Scale: Using a structured approach
An AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) (Perkins et al, 2024) (Table 3) provides a framework for ethical integration of AI technology into formal assessment strategies. It provides for varied levels of integration, each level specifying the extent of allowed Gen AI use and student responsibility. The scale is flexible, recognising that while a linear model is beneficial for its simplicity, it must also accommodate the diverse nature of academic tasks which may be particularly useful in professional development for healthcare delivery. The AIAS has been designed as a practical tool which can be tailor based to the ONMSD own policy decisions regarding the use of Gen AI tools in academic evaluations. Each level of the scale was intended to be cumulative, in terms of permitted AI engagement.
